#  Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant details using multiple Machine Learning algorithms. It helps financial institutions automate and improve the accuracy of loan eligibility decisions.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that determines whether a loan should be approved or not, based on customer information such as income, education, employment status, credit history, and loan amount.

##  Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for model building and preprocessing)

##  Machine Learning Models Implemented

1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
5. **Decision Tree Classifier**

Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data using **StandardScaler**.

##  Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Load the dataset containing applicant and loan details.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize data distributions and relationships among variables.  
4. **Model Training** – Train multiple classification models on preprocessed data.  
5. **Evaluation** – Compare models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.  
6. **Prediction** – Predict loan approval for new applicants.

##  Results

After comparing all models, **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)** achieved the **highest accuracy and performance** on the test dataset.  
Its simplicity and probabilistic approach provided excellent generalization for this classification task.
